# “Ground State Energies of 16,242 Molecules”- from Kaggle
## The Goal

- The goal is to utilize neural networks to fit high dimensional models to model complex atomic systems. More specifically, we want to use these models to compute the atomization energy of a CHNOPS molecule.

## The Experiment

- Given the atomic charges and positions of atoms in a molecule, can we calculate the atomization energy with a trained neural network?

- A neural network will be adopted in order  to obtain a non-linear regression model.
